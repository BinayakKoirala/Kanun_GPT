# Kanun_GPT

Hello everyone, I have made a small project related to Constitution of Nepal. In this project, I have used free Hugging Face Text model "neural-chat-7b-v3-1.Q4_K_M.gguf" Link : https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/neural-chat-7B-v3-1-GGUF. I have used Chroma DB as an vector database to store the embeddings created by the model. I have used flask for the interface.

This app basically is trained on the constitution of nepal : https://rb.gy/plnyh4 . Let me know if you find any mistakes or want to know more about it. Contact : binayaktv@gmail.com
